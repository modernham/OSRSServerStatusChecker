# OSRSServerStatusChecker
Displays ping across Old school runescape servers.
Written in python. 

Code from the server status scraper credit to isaychris which is used in his console version here:
https://github.com/isaychris/osrs-world-pinger

In order to run you must install a few modules:

`pip install PyQt5

pip install requests

pip install beautifulsoup4`


Servers on the left will show from lowest ping to highest from top to bottom.
The Table to the right is a bit outdated and shows some worlds that no longer exist, and is missing some. (worlds change often)
